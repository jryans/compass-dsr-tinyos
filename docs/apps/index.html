<p><h3>Multihop Counter (UnicastCountToLeds)</h3></p>

<p>UnicastCountToLeds acts very similarly to the TinyOS example applicaton
RadioCountToLeds, in which a 4Hz counter is maintained, and then the value
is sent over the radio and displayed on LEDs of another node. However, here
only node 0 sends a unicast message to node 1 with its value, rather than
having each node broadcast its value in an AM packet every time it gets
updated. Normally this would require nodes 0 and 1 to be within radio range
of each other, but by simply using the send and receive components from the
COMPASS framework, the message can be delivered across multiple hops to reach
node 1 (assuming there is a path connecting node 0 and 1 in the network).</p>

<p><h3>Visual Route Tracer (MultihopLight)</h3></p>

<p>The intensity of light at a source mote A is used to control an LED at a destination mote B. 
The COMPASS multihop framework is used to allow the source and destination to be an arbitrary 
number of hops away from each other. By reducing radio power to a low level, this application 
acts as simple visual demo of the utility of multihop communication. All other nodes act as 
forwarders between nodes A and B, and can be added and removed at any time, causing the routing 
path between A and B to change in real time.  The on/off setting of this LED is displayed throughout 
the path taken by the packets, making this system a rudimentary route tracer.</p>
