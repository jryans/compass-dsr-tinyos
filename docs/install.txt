Installation
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Ensure that you have a working installation of TinyOS
   2.0.2.  For more information about TinyOS itself, take a
   look at http://www.tinyos.net/.

2. Either download the most recent release from the
   framework homepage, or use CVS to get the latest code
   from tinyos-2.x-contrib/rice/framework.  The framework 
   directory structure is set up so that it could easily be 
   integrated into your TinyOS installation, however
   keeping the two separate is suggested to avoid any 
   conflicts that may arise as TinyOS evolves.

3. Assuming that your TinyOS environment variables are set
   correctly (see step 1), you should be ready to compile
   applications that make use of the framework!  There are a
   number of directories that must be included when
   compiling framework applications, but there is no need to
   add them manually or adjust any paths.  The included
   applications simply use a small script to add all of the
   required directories automatically, which should be useful
   when building your own applications as well.

4. Test that everything is setup properly by going into the
   directory of one of the included applications and typing
   "make <target>", replacing <target> with your platform of
   choice.  Please note that at this time all testing was 
   done solely on the micaz platform, but we would be very
   interested to hear how well the framework works on other
   platforms.
