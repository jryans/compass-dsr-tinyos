README for MultihopLight
Author/Contact: Ryan Stinnett <jryans@rice.edu>

Description:

The intensity of light at a source mote is used to control an LED at a
destination mote. The COMPASS multihop framework is used to allow the source
and destination to be an arbitrary number of hops away from each other. By
reducing radio power to a low level, this application acts as simple visual
demo of the utility of multihop communication.

Known bugs/limitations:

None.
