% Channel Parameters
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The channel model is based on the Log-Normal Shadowing Path Loss Model.
% It defines the gain at which other nodes receive a signal when a node
% transmits. All values must be positive. Parameters:
%     PATH_LOSS_EXPONENT           an adimensional constant
%     SHADOWING_STANDARD_DEVIATION in dB
%     PL_D0                        close-in reference pathloss, in dB
%     D0                           close-in reference distance, in meters

PATH_LOSS_EXPONENT = 3.3;
SHADOWING_STANDARD_DEVIATION = 5.5;
PL_D0 = 52.1;
D0 = 1.0;

%
% Radio Parameters
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The radio parameters provide a mechanism to incorporate node variations.
% These variations introduce link asymmetry. The variations have a static
% and a dynamic component. WHITE_GAUSSIAN_NOISE encodes the dynamic
% variation of a node's noise floor readings at runtime, while the
% covariance matrix encodes the static differences in noise floor and
% output strength across nodes.
%
% Parameters:
%     NOISE_FLOOR          the baseline noise floor in dBm
%     WHITE_GAUSSIAN_NOISE the standard deviation of noise measurements
%     S11, S12, S21, S22   the values of the covariance matrix that
%                          represents hardware variations.
%     S11                  the per-node variance of the noise floor
%     S12                  covariance between noise floor and output power
%     S21                  must be equal to S12
%     S22                  the per-node variance of output power

% Topology Parameters
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Terrain dimensions and node positions are in meters.
% Parameters:
%     TOPOLOGY       the basic topology to use, whose valid values are:
%                      1 for a GRID
%                      2 for a UNIFORM distribution
%                      3 for a RANDOM distribution
%                      4 for positions read from a FILE
%                    details:
%                      o GRID: Node placement starts at (0, 0). You must
%                      specify the GRID_UNIT variable (spacing in meters).
%                      The number of nodes has to be square of an integer.
%                      o UNIFORM: Based on the number of nodes, the physical
%                      terrain is divided into a number of cells. Within
%                      each cell, a node is placed randomly.
%                      o RANDOM: Nodes are placed randomly within the physical
%                      terrain.
%                      o FILE: Position of nodes is read from TOPOLOGY_FILE
%                      (user-defined). The format of the file is:
%                           nodeid  Xcoordinate  Ycoordinate
%                      The nodeid values must start with 0.
%     TERRAIN_DIMENSIONS_X the width of the terrain area (meters)
%     TERRAIN_DIMENSIONS_Y the depth of the terrain area (meters)
%
